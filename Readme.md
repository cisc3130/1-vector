# Homework 1: Implement vector methods

Modify the file Vector.java to implement the two last methods. The comments in the file indicate how they should be implemented.

Test your implementation by compiling and running Vector.java.

Your code must be readable, with comments, meaningful variable names, proper indentation, and formatting.

# Your code must compile and run. Code that does not compile will receive a grade of zero.
