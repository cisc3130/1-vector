# Homework 1: Implement a vector class

Design and implement a Vector class. Completing this assignment correctly will demonstrate mastery of vectors, templates, C++ classes and dynamic memory allocation.

## Requirements and grading

* Modify the file Vector.h to fill in the methods that are missing.

* Test your implementation by compiling and running main.cpp.

* Your code must be readable, with comments, meaningful variable names, proper indentation, and formatting.

* Note: you may not include the STL vector header file; you should implement each method completely.
